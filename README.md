# Handwritten-Character-Recognitioin
This repo contains information about new research field of machine learning that is handwritten character recognition.

To run the project files, put Handwritten Character Recognition.ipynb and model1.h5 in the same directory.

OpenCV-Python has to be installed in your system. If not that find the installation here https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

You also need Numpy, matplotlib, tensor flow and imutils library in your device.

After installing all of them just run the Handwritten Character Recognition.ipynb file.

I provided some example images for prediction, however if you want you can
download any jpeg or png files and just change the path of the image in image_path = “image path” and you are good to go.

Hope you find my project interesting.
